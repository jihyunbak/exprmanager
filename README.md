# ExprManager

A minimal helper package with routine procedures for computational experiments in python.

Creating an `ExprManager` class instance is like opening an experiment folder, where the input configurations and the output results can be saved.

## Note on usage

At this moment, this code is intended for personal use. My current practice is to make a copy (rather than clone) of the package into a specific project folder, and let it evolve to meet the project-specific needs without necessarily syncing back to the central repository (this).
